  // FAQ items
  faqItems: [
    {
      question: 'How can you help me get more leads?',
      answer: "I build automated lead generation systems tailored to your business. That might mean AI prospecting that scans for ideal customers, speed-to-lead automation that responds to inquiries in minutes instead of hours, or local business targeting systems. I've built systems that save clients 20 hours a week on manual prospecting. We'll start with a strategy session to figure out the best approach for your situation.",
    },
    {
      question: "What if we're already getting leads but not converting them?",
      answer: "That's often a follow-up and process problem, not a lead quality problem. I build automated follow-up sequences, AI-powered lead qualification, and streamlined sales workflows that make sure no opportunity falls through the cracks. Sometimes the fix is as simple as responding faster. Sometimes it needs a more sophisticated system. I'll audit your current sales process and tell you exactly where the drop-off is happening.",
    },
    {
      question: 'Can AI actually help my business grow?',
      answer: "Maybe. I cut through the hype and assess whether AI makes sense for your specific situation. AI is powerful for things like automated lead qualification, instant customer responses, document processing, and data analysis. But sometimes simple automation is the better answer. I'll give you an honest assessment of what will actually move the needle, whether that's AI, automation, or something else entirely.",
    },
    {
      question: "What does 'Growth Partnership' actually mean?",
      answer: "It means I don't just build something and disappear. I stay on as your ongoing tech and growth partner. I keep optimizing your systems, look for new growth opportunities, and make sure your technology keeps up with your business. Monthly retainer, regular check-ins, and someone who actually picks up the phone when you need them.",
    },
    {
      question: "What if a developer ghosted us and our systems are broken?",
      answer: "This happens more often than you'd think. I specialize in tech rescue: assessing the damage, fixing what's broken, and getting you back on track. I'll audit what you have and give you an honest assessment of what's salvageable, what needs rebuilding, and what it'll cost. Then I'll fix it in a way that's maintainable so you're not stuck in this situation again.",
    },
    {
      question: "How quickly can I expect to see results?",
      answer: "It depends on the project, but I bias toward fast wins. Lead generation and automation systems typically show results within 2-4 weeks. Larger custom builds take 4-8 weeks. I always try to find quick wins we can ship early while building toward the bigger vision.",
    },
    {
      question: "How much does this cost?",
      answer: "Projects typically range from $1,500 for quick wins to $15K+ for larger builds. I also offer ongoing growth partnerships on a monthly retainer. I'll always give you a clear quote upfront — no surprises, no scope creep billing.",
    },
    {
      question: "What happens on the first call?",
      answer: "You tell me what's going on in your business. I ask questions, listen, and give you an honest take on what I'd do. If I can help, I'll outline a rough approach and next steps. If I'm not the right fit, I'll tell you that too. 20 minutes, no pitch.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need to know anything technical?",
      answer: "Not at all. I translate between business goals and technical solutions — that's the whole point. You tell me what you need the business to do, and I figure out how to make the technology do it. No jargon required.",
    },
    {
      question: "What industries do you work with?",
      answer: "I've worked with nonprofits, real estate, education, professional services, and local businesses. The common thread is small teams ready to grow who need a technical partner, not a vendor. If you have customers and want more of them, we can probably work together.",
    },
    {
      question: "What if I just need advice, not a full project?",
      answer: "The first call is always free. If you just need a second opinion or a sanity check on a tech decision, that's totally fine. For deeper consulting, I offer paid strategy sessions.",
    },
